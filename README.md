# bayreachbot
breadbot but for bayreach

The bot is fully functional, just go over to discord's developer portal and create your own bot and copy and paste the bot's tag into the bottom of main.py
You will need to have discord.py installed on your computer. 

Running the bot:
1. Run createtable.py to create the sqlite file.
2. Run main.py and wait for "Bot is ready" in console.
3. Use .help in the discord channel to get info on commands.
